# 3vGnometer
My gnometer layout for Rainmeter on Windows

1. Install Rainmeter @ https://www.rainmeter.net/
2. Download (or clone) this repo, and double click on the .rmskin package - it should ask you if you want to load my layout.
3. Right click on any skin on the desktop and click "Edit Skin" to piss around with it.
